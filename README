A simple, clean full-stack starter that brings together FastAPI on the backend and React (TypeScript) on the frontend. 

Also the goal is to speed up starting new projects, so I don’t have to rebuild the full-stack structure from scratch every time.

Everything runs through Docker, supports live reload during development, and is organized in a way that makes it easy to build out small or medium-size projects.
